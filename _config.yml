description: Tommaso Tubaldo is a researcher specializing in intelligent systems, robotics, and machine learning. He holds a Master’s degree in Control System Engineering from the University of Padova, where his academic training focused on robotics and control, computer vision, reinforcement learning, and learning-based dynamical systems. His master’s thesis investigated the application of Vision Language Models in robotics, with particular emphasis on perception and decision-making for autonomous robotic systems.

He is currently a Research Associate within the Machine Intelligence and Development (M.IN.D.) team at Fraunhofer Italia IEC, where he conducts applied and foundational research in robotics and machine learning. His work centers on the development of learning-based control and perception algorithms for intelligent robotic systems.

Previously, he was a research intern at the Intelligent Robotics and Systems Laboratory (IRIS Lab) at the University of Aveiro, Portugal, where he carried out an Erasmus+ research project for his master’s thesis. He also holds a Bachelor’s degree in Mechatronics Engineering from the University of Padova.
